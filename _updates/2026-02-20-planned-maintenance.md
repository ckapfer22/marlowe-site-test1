Marlowe will undergo scheduled maintenance on February 24-25 for firmware updates and network fabric optimization. The maintenance window is expected to last approximately 8 hours. Running jobs will be checkpointed where possible, and the scheduling queue will drain starting February 23.

Users should plan accordingly and ensure critical jobs are submitted before the drain period begins. Updates will be posted to the Marlowe Slack channel.
