The Marlowe Dashboard is now live, providing at-a-glance visibility into cluster utilization, allocation tracking, and research impact metrics. The dashboard covers all allocation cycles with daily GPU-hour breakdowns by PI, school, and project.

Key features include cycle-over-cycle comparison, node health status, and job scale distribution analysis.
