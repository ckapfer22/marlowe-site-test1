Marlowe's fifth allocation cycle has officially launched, with allocations awarded to research groups across seven Stanford schools. Cycle 5 represents the largest allocation round to date, with multiple groups receiving 8+ node allocations for foundation model training.

New in Cycle 5: improved scheduling policies for multi-node jobs and a streamlined project application process.
