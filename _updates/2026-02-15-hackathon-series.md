In partnership with the Doerr School of Sustainability, Marlowe is launching a GPU hackathon series designed to help research groups go from zero to multi-node training. The hands-on workshops will provide dedicated Marlowe time, expert guidance from Research Data Scientists, and collaborative problem-solving.

The first hackathon targets climate modeling and earth science applications. Contact Brian Chivers or Elliana Abrahams for details.
