After your project has been approved, connecting is simple!

## SSH

The login server you will need to ssh into is `login.marlowe.stanford.edu`. You will need to ssh in with your SUNet ID.

So, if your SUNet ID was `bob`, your login command would look like:

```
ssh bob@login.marlowe.stanford.edu
```

You will be prompted to provide both your password and duo two-factor authentication credentials before it logs you in.

If you receive a message `"Connection closed by 171.67.99.202 port 22"` when trying to login, it usually indicates that your account is not fully active yet. A confirmation email is usually sent to inform you of full activation.
