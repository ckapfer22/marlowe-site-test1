Marlowe has multiple software packages pre-installed and available for use.

Most are installed as modules and can be listed by running `module avail` in your terminal.

The only modules loaded by default are `slurm` and `gcc/13.1.0`. If you need other modules automatically loaded, it is recommended to add `module load <modulename>` to your `~/.bashrc` file.

Choose a topic from the sidebar to learn more about specific software packages.
